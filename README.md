# 07 Project 1: Mix & Match: Cocktail & Music Video Generator

## Concept

AS A user <br>
I WANT a recommendation for a cocktail and curated music video <br>
SO THAT I can find new, exciting mixed drinks and music without requiring research.

## User experience

- The user is greeted with a landing page. They then click the "Match My Mix" button to get started.

- A modal appears, asking the user to verify their age. Once that is complete, the user can select a type of alcohol. Click the "Match My Mix" button, and see the results.

- The results will include an image of the recommended drink, the recipe for creating this concoction, and a video selected as a companion to the user-selection.
